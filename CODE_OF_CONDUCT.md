## Inclusivity and Accessibility Commitment

Inclusivity is one of the core principles of Knight Hacks. We are committed to ensuring our events and community is accessible to all. We are open to all backgrounds and give equal opportunity to all. Treat everyone with respect and allow for an open atmosphere.

Knight Hacks also aligns with the Major League Hacking Philosophy: Every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment. We are continually working to improve the inclusivity and accessibility of our programs. Feedback is welcome on how we can do better.

## Enforcement and Reporting Process

We take violations of the Code of Conduct seriously. Enforcement of these rules will be guided by the procedures in UCF’s Golden Rule Student Handbook and by Major League Hacking’s event policies, ensuring a fair and effective process. Below is how Knight Hacks handles reports and enforces this Code.

Reporting a Concern: If you experience or encounter any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, we urge you to report it as soon as possible. Some ways of reporting include:

- Contact Event Organizers
- Online / After-Event Reporting
- MLH Reporting (Hackathon)

We handle all reports of misconduct promptly and confidentially. Knight Hacks organizers will take every report seriously and investigate the situation to the best of our ability. We understand it can be difficult to come forward, we will treat reporters with respect and care. Privacy will always be maintained as well as details of an incident. We will also ensure that no retaliation happens against someone who reports a problem.

Immediate Action: If the situation is urgent, Knight Hacks staff will take swift action to ensure safety. This could include contacting UCF Campus Police, or providing an escort to anyone who feels unsafe. Safety of our participants is a top priority, in an emergency do not hesitate to call 911 or UCF Police.

Consequences for violations: If an individual is found to have violated the Code of Conduct, Knight Hacks organizers will take appropriate action. The exact consequences depend on the severity and nature of the violation:

- Minor Infractions: A formal warning may be issues to the offender, and they will be asked to correct the behavior immediately.
- For more serious infractions or repeated offenses, the person will be black listed from Knight Hacks and MLH. Being disqualified from MLH will disqualify you from any MLH certified event and you will not be allowed to attend.

All decisions regarding enforcement will be made by Knight Hacks organizers in consultation, when appropriate, with UCF officials and MLH representatives. Our organizers are committed to fairness, anyone accused of a violation will have a chance to share their perspective as part of the review.

UCF Student Conduct Involvement: Knight Hacks is a Registered Student Organization at UCF, and thus our events and members are subject to University regulations. The UCF Golden Rule Student Handbook provides the overarching framework for student behavior. If a Code of Conduct violation also constitutes a violation of UCF’s policies or the law, the matter may be escalated to the University’s Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) for formal review. This means that in addition to Knight Hacks’ immediate actions, a violator could face University-level disciplinary proceedings. Such proceedings could result in sanctions as defined by UCF. Knight Hacks will cooperate fully with any University investigations. Our enforcement process is intended to complement, not replace, the UCF conduct process.

Confidentiality and Retaliation: We want reporters and witnesses to feel safe. Knight Hacks will keep the identity of reporters confidential and will not tolerate any retaliation against someone for raising a concern or assisting in an investigation. If you believe you are facing retaliation, please report that as well, it is a separate violation of this Code.

In summary, Knight Hacks is to handle all enforcement in a way that is transparent, just, and aligned with both UCF policy and MLH’s standards. We are committed to resolving issues in a manner that ensures the behavior is corrected and our community remains safe and respectful.
