# Welcome to the Knight Hacks Repository

The mission of Knight Hacks is to develop the computer science skills of UCF students and to build an appreciation for real-world uses of programming. We provide weekly workshops on cutting-edge technologies, programming, tech interviews, and career development. Members receive career guidance through our mentorship program, and develop their skills in our projects program. Each year, Knight Hacks hosts UCF's largest hackathon, a technology fair and invention marathon where students race to build tech projects in 36 hours. Above all, Knight Hacks aims to support a diverse, welcoming, and inclusive tech community at UCF.
